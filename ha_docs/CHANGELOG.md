# Changelog

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-31

Initial release.

- Clones a configurable git repo/branch and rebuilds when the commit SHA changes.
- MkDocs Material with search, dark mode, and auto-generated navigation.
- GitHub-identical heading slugs via `ghslug.py`, so existing anchor links keep
  resolving.
- Served over ingress; no ports exposed, no external font or CDN requests.
- A failed fetch or build keeps the previously built site online.
